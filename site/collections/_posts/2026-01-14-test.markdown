In Week 05, you generated **lots of raw material** (30+ ideas, visuals, prompts, sketches). That was **divergence** — casting the net wide.

Now in Week 06, you move into **convergence**: making sense of the chaos, seeing patterns, and choosing what’s worth pursuing.

Think of this stage as **story-shaping**: instead of 30 random fragments, you want 3–4 promising directions that feel coherent, interesting, and communicable.

**Suggested Collaboration Tool:** https://plus.excalidraw.com/

## 01. Clustering (Finding Patterns)

**Definition:** Clustering is grouping similar ideas together so you can see themes emerge.

**Why we do it:**

- Helps reduce overwhelm from too many ideas.
- Makes hidden connections visible (ideas that seemed random may cluster into a theme).
- Creates **narrative “buckets”** you can build into storylines.

**How to do it:**

1. **Spread everything out** (print, sticky notes, digital board).
2. **Look for affinities**:
    - Visual similarity (aesthetic style, mood).
    - Thematic overlap (topics, metaphors, audiences).
    - Functional alignment (how it solves the problem).
3. **Label clusters** with quick headlines (e.g., “Speculative Futures,” “Everyday Accessibility,” “Emotional Resonance”).
4. Aim for **3–5 clusters**, each with its own energy.

**Example:**

If your wicked problem is _Future of Education_, clusters might emerge like:

- **Utopian Classrooms** (AI as playful collaborator).
- **Dystopian Scenarios** (AI surveillance, control).
- **Hybrid Futures** (AI as quiet background support).

## 02. Filtering (Choosing What Matters)

**Definition:** Filtering is evaluating which ideas have the most potential to move forward.

**Why we do it:**

- You can’t prototype everything.
- Filtering lets you **prioritize ideas that are fresh, feasible, and aligned with your team’s goals**.

**How to do it:**

1. **Set criteria** (3–4 is enough):
    - Relevance (does it address the wicked problem clearly?).
    - Novelty (is it fresh, surprising, not cliché?).
    - Communicability (can you tell a compelling story around it?).
    - Excitement (does the team actually care about it?).
2. **Score or vote** (dot voting, sticky notes, or quick group discussion).
3. **Narrow to 2–3 directions** for critique.
4. Pick **one direction** to prototype — knowing you can pivot later.

**Pro-tip:** Filtering doesn’t mean throwing ideas away — it means **parking them**. Keep a “parking lot” of good-but-not-now ideas.

## 03. From Chaos → Coherence

- **Raw ideas** (Week 05) = sparks, fragments, quantity.
- **Clusters** (Week 06) = emerging patterns, buckets of meaning.
- **Filters** (Week 06) = choices, focusing the narrative.
- **Prototype** (Week 07) = one direction embodied in a tangible form.

---
## 04. Quick Activities

- **Affinity Mapping:** Put all outputs on a wall or Miro board, drag similar ones together, and name the clusters.
- **Dot Voting:** Give each teammate 3 sticky dots; place them on the ideas they find most compelling.
- **Headline Exercise:** For each cluster, write a one-sentence “newspaper headline” that captures its story.
- **Decision Matrix:** Rank ideas on a 2x2 (e.g., _High Novelty vs. High Relevance_).

---
## 05. Reflection Prompts (to document)

- What surprised you about how your ideas grouped together?
- Which cluster felt most promising — and why?
- How did AI outputs shape the clusters (did they reinforce patterns? introduce weird outliers?).
- Which ideas did you filter out — and what was your rationale?

---

By the end of Week 06, your group should have:

- 3 named clusters of ideas.
- Notes on why you filtered/selected one direction.
- A rough sketch of your prototype concept (storyboard, mockup, or narrative outline).
